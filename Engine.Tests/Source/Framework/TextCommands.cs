/* 
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Tests.Framework.TextCommands
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 * 
 * A base class for automated tests where the input files are text files interpreted line by line as commands.  They're 
 * loaded from a folder, interpreted by the derived class, and the output is saved to files and compared to other files 
 * containing the expected result.
 * 
 * The benefit of this approach is that you never have to hand code the output.  You can run the tests without
 *	 an expected output file, look over the actual output file, and if it's acceptable rename it to become the
 *	 expected output file.
 *		  
 * Usage:
 * 
 *		- Derive a class that has the [TestFixture] attribute.
 *		- Create a function with the [Test] attribute that calls <TestFolder()>, pointing it to the input files.
 *		- Define <OutputOf()> to convert the data to string output.
 *		- All files in the test folder in the format "[Test Name] - Input.[extension]" will be tested when NUnit runs.
 *		- A corresponding file "[Test Name] - Actual Output.txt" will be created for each one.
 *		- If it matches the contents of the file "[Test Name] - Expected Output.txt", the test will pass.  If it doesn't,
 *		  that file doesn't exist, or an exception was thrown, the test will fail.
 *
