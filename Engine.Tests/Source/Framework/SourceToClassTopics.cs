/* 
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Tests.Framework.SourceToClassTopics
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 * 
 * A base class for automated tests where sample source files are run through Natural Docs normally and then the 
 * <Topics> are extracted by class and combined.  The portions of those <Topics> being tested are saved to files 
 * and compared to other files containing the  expected result.
 * 
 *	 The benefit of this approach is that you never have to hand code the output.  You can run the tests without
 *	 an expected output file, look over the actual output file, and if it's acceptable rename it to become the
 *	 expected output file.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 *		- Derive a class that has the [TestFixture] attribute.
 *		- Create a function with the [Test] attribute that calls <TestFolder()>, pointing it to the input files.
 *		- Define <OutputOf()> to convert some facet of the <Topic> list to string output.
 *		- Since the input files and output files will not match 1:1, the generated result files will be similar to
 *		   [Class Name] - Actual Output.txt.
 *		- If it matches the contents of the file "[Class Name] - Expected Output.txt", the test will pass.  If it doesn't,
 *		  that file doesn't exist, or an exception was thrown, the test will fail.
 *

		 * of there being more than one topic in an input file, or none at all.
		 * 
		 * You do not need to worry about catching exceptions unless the test is supposed to trigger them.  Uncaught exceptions
		 * will be handled automatically and cause the test to fail.  If the exception was intended as part of correct operation then 
		 * you must catch it to prevent this.
		 * 
		 * This function should not return null or an empty string as part of a successful test.  Doing so will cause the test to fail.
		 * If a test is supposed to generated no output, return a string such as "test successful" instead.
