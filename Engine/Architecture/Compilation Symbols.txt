_______________________________________________________________________________


Macros: SQLite Character Mode

	Determines which mode SQLite will be run in.  If neither of them are defined it will use UTF-8.

	SQLITE_UTF8 - Use SQLite in UTF-8 mode.
	SQLITE_UTF16 - Use SQLite in UTF-16 mode.
	
	Running in UTF-8 mode means a smaller database file, which means less disk access and less memory use.  It also 
	means more of the database can stay in the memory it does use.  However, it also means strings have to be constantly 
	converted between SQLite's UTF-8 strings and C#'s native UTF-16 ones.  Having these symbols available lets you
	easily test the performance tradeoff.

	Testing in March 2020 after upgrading SQLite to 3.31.1 showed that using UTF-16 speeds up the parsing and link 
	resolving stages, but you give almost all of it back on the building stage.  Therefore it's not worth the extra memory 
	and disk space.
	
	Note, however, that this only applies to new databases.  When testing, you must delete CodeDB.nd for it to really take
	effect.
	
	
Macro: SHOW_NDMARKUP

	If defined, Natural Docs will put a copy of the <NDMarkup> in the output.
