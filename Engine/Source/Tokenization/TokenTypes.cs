	 * String - A string.  Also covers char constants for languages that have them.

	/* Enum: PrototypeParsingType
	 * 
	 * Null - Returned when the token is out of bounds or one of these values hasn't been assigned to it yet.
	 * 
	 * StartOfPrototypeSection - The first token of a new prototype section.  It is possible for these to appear without
	 *										 corresponding <EndOfPrototypeSections>.
	 * EndOfPrototypeSection - The last token of a prototype section, causing the next token to start a new one.  It is possible
	 *										for these to appear without corresponding <StartOfPrototypeSections>.
	 * 
	 * StartOfParams - The start of a parameter list, such as an opening parenthesis.
	 * EndOfParams - The end of a parameter list, such as a closing parenthesis.
	 * ParamSeparator - A separator between parameters, such as a comma.
	 * 
	 * Type - The type excluding all modifiers and qualifiers, such as "int" in "unsigned int" or "Class" in "PkgA.PkgB.Class".
	 * TypeModifier - A separate word modifying a type, such as "const" in "const int".
	 * TypeQualifier - Everything prior to the ending word in a qualified type, such as "PkgA.PkgB." in "PkgA.PkgB.Class".
	 * OpeningTypeModifier - An opening symbol modifying a type, such as "[" in "int[]" or "<" in "List<int>".
	 * ClosingTypeModifier - A closing symbol modifying a type, such as "]" in "int[]" or ">" in "List<int>".
	 * 
	 * NameTypeSeparator - In languages that use them, the symbol separating a variable name from its type, such as ":" in
	 *									"x: int".  In languages that simply use a space this type won't appear.
	 *
	 * Name - The name of the parameter or the code element being defined by the prototype.
	 * 
	 * ParamModifier - Any parameter modifiers.  These usually appear with the name but are part of the type, and aren't
	 *						   shared with other parameters inheriting the type, such as "*" in "int *x" in C++.
	 * OpeningParamModifier - An opening symbol modifying a parameter.  These usually appear with the name but are part
	 *									  of the type, such as "[" in "int x[5]".
	 * ClosingParamModifier - A closing symbol modifying a parameter.  These usually appear with the name but are part of
	 *									 the type, such as "]" in "int x[5]".
	 *														
	 * DefaultValueSeparator - The symbol separating the name and type from its default value, such as "=" or ":=".
	 * DefaultValue - The default value of the parameter.
	 * 
	 * PropertyValueSeparator - The symbol separating a property name from its value, such as "=" or ":".
	 * PropertyValue - The value of a property, such as "12" in "@RequestForEnhancement(id = 12)" in Java annotations.

	 * PrePrototypeLine - Part of a line that should be shown before the prototype.
	 * 
	 * StartOfParents - The start of a parent list.
	 * ParentSeparator - A separator between parents, such as a comma.

	 * StartOfBody - The start of the class's body if it is present in the prototype.  Nothing beyond that is demarcated, including the end
	 *								of the body.  This token is just present to indicate that the prototype does contain a body.
