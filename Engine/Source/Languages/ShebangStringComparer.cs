/* 
 * Class: CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Languages.ShebangStringComparer
 * ____________________________________________________________________________
 * 
 * An implementation of IComparer that incorporates string length.  Longer strings are less than shorter strings, and if 
 * two strings are equal lengths it does a regular string comparison.  This is done so when you iterate through a
 * <Collections.SortedStringTable> of shebang strings, the longer strings come first.  This is important because someone
 * could conceivably define one language with shebang string "php5" and another with just "php".  We want the longer
 * one to be tested against first.
